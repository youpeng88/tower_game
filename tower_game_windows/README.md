    1/19/16 11:49 AM: Included text with lifebars
    1/19/16 1:53 PM: Enemies get stronger and give more money every 10 waves. Required a new initial variable money_earned_per_enemy

# Changes by Alex:
    1-18-16 10:30am: Changed the Enemy.point_at_base function to make all enemies move in the right direction. Changed the direction and distance calculation to floats and the speed to 2. Previously, enemies had speed one so any direction that was less than 1 would floor to zero. Now the directions floor to either 0, 1, or 2, but the upper left sprites no longer have both directions floor to zero
    1-18-16 10:35am: Changed the Enemy.point_at_base function and the angle function to allow proper rotation. The angle calculation now takes two vectors, and using the dot product calculates the angle between the vectors, rotating the appropriate ammount. In order to prevent rotation on every turn, if angle is less than 1 the enemy does not rotate. The angle function catches divide by zero exceptions.
    1-18-16 11:10am: Modified the .png images for the sprites on the board to be transparent. For pygame on Windows the game can now have transparent pieces. It looks better? Maybe a better background?
    1-19-16 00:10am: Modified the save and load functionality to keep the defense_towers from the previous game upon load game.
    1-19-16 02:26am: Added a highscore archive to keep track of and display highscores. This involved: creating a highscore class, saving the score, adding user input for name, calling the scores at the beginning. Also changed to grass background.
    1-20-16 11:47am: Made the game smoother by removing unnecessary clock tick. Fixed bug in menu which prevented entire screen from filling. Made score icon transparent.
    1-20-16 2:04pm:  Made the game fullscreen with smooth transitions between screens. Sidebar now on right for aesthetics. 
    1-20-16 3:32pm:  Added knights that chase demons and can be placed with the right mousebutton
    1-21-16 1:10am:  Make the save_game feature save the knights and enemies as well. Added functionality for game start and menu performance if no .txt files for platform, highscores, or saved_state. Game now saves username for highscore purposes.
    1-21-16 2:08am:  Fixed tower cannonball range issue. Fixed no platform issue.
